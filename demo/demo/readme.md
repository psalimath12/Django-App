This is a basic Django application named "demo" with a single app called "myapp".

### Project Structure

The project has the following key files:

  * **`demo/`**: The main Django project directory.
      * **`asgi.py`**: ASGI configuration for the project.
      * **`settings.py`**: Contains the project's settings, including installed apps (`myapp` is listed here), database configuration, and template settings.
      * **`urls.py`**: The main URL configuration for the project, including a path to the `myapp.urls`.
      * **`wsgi.py`**: WSGI configuration for the project.
  * **`myapp/`**: This is a Django app within the project. (Note: `myapp` directory content was not provided, so typical contents are assumed for the description.)
      * `views.py`: (Assumed) Contains the view functions for the app.
      * `models.py`: (Assumed) Defines database models for the app.
      * `urls.py`: (Assumed) URL configurations specific to `myapp`.
      * `admin.py`: (Assumed) Registers models for the Django admin interface.
  * **`templates/`**: (Assumed typical location for templates, though not explicitly shown as a directory in the provided files, `base.html`, `home.html`, and `todos.html` suggest its presence).
      * **`base.html`**: A base HTML template that includes Bootstrap for styling and defines blocks for title and content.
      * **`home.html`**: Extends `base.html` and displays a personalized home page message.
      * **`todos.html`**: Extends `base.html` and displays a list of to-do items, showing their title and completion status.

### Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**: `cd demo`
3.  **Install Django**:
    ```bash
    pip install Django
    # or for Mac/Linux
    pip3 install Django
    ```
4.  **Make migrations**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
5.  **Apply migrations**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
6.  **Create a superuser** (for Django admin access):
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create a username, email, and password.
7.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Usage

  * Access the application in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
  * The home page (`home.html`) should be accessible.
  * If a URL for `todos.html` is configured in `myapp/urls.py`, you should be able to view the to-do list.
  * Access the Django admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` using the superuser credentials you created.

### Customization

  * **`settings.py`**: Modify database settings, add more installed apps, or configure other project-wide options.
  * **`urls.py`**: Define new URL patterns for your project or include URLs from other apps.
  * **`myapp/`**: Add new models in `models.py`, create new views in `views.py`, and define their URL patterns in `myapp/urls.py`.
  * **Templates**: Create new HTML templates or modify existing ones (`base.html`, `home.html`, `todos.html`) to change the front-end appearance and content.
